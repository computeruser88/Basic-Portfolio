        <p>A customer service worker, I am a graduate of Penn State University with a Master's Degree in Software Engineering. Currently I attend the Coding Boot Camp at UCSD Extension with aspirations to become a web developer. In my spare time I have competed twice in the USAPL as a Masters 1 powerlifter and won second place in the California State Games: as a 74kg lifter in 2015, and as an 83kg lifter in 2016. I have a passion for many musical genres and also dabbled in amateur music creation when I was younger.</p>
